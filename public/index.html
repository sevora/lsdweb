                It is a bad idea to put your OpenAI API Key on some random website on the internet.
                But <a href="https://github.com/sevora" target="_blank">I would not</a> steal your keys. I just don't
                want to go
                bankrupt when people use this site that I'm already hosting for free.

                Remember, you are using your OpenAI API Key here, violating
                <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/" target="_blank">OpenAI's Usage Policies</a> will
                be attributed to your account
                such as searching for explicit content.

                If you're still hesitant, you can also host the website on your own by downloading the <a
